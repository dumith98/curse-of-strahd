# COLLEGE OF ELOQUENCE

Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art

of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more persuasive than facts. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments and plucking at heartÂ­ strings to appeal to the emotions of audiences.
