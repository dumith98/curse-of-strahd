At 6th level, you add the [Animate Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead) spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast [Animate Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead), you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:

-   The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.

-   The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.
